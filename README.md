# machine-learning-model-evaluation-iris
Performance comparion of various machine learning models on background and foreground classification for iris data.

### Machine learning models used:
1. Logistic regression
2. Support Vector Machines - linear and rbf
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest
5. Adaboost classifier
6. Gradient boost classifier

### Model Selection

Except for Logistic regression, best model for each machine learning method is selected using hyperparameter tuning.

### Evaluated results for each model

1. Cross validation score
2. Mean score
3. Standard deviation
4. Confusion matrix
5. Precision, Recall and F1 score
